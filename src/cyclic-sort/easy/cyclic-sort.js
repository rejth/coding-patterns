/**
 * We are given an array containing n objects.
 * Each object, when created, was assigned a unique number from the range 1 to n based on their creation sequence.
 * This means that the object with sequence number 3 was created just before the object with sequence number 4.
 *
 * Write a function to sort the objects in-place on their creation sequence number in O(n) and without using any extra space.
 * For simplicity, letâ€™s assume we are passed an integer array containing only the sequence numbers,
 * though each number is actually an object.
 *
 * Input: [3, 1, 5, 4, 2]
 * Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
